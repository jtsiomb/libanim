libanim
-------
A general-purpose hierarchical keyframe animation library

Libanim is a C animation library, which can be used as a generic framework to
add keyframe interpolation tracks for any single-valued or 3-vector parameters,
or at a slightly higher level as a hierarchical PRS (position/rotation/scaling)
animation node framework for 3D graphics programs.

Libanim depends on libvmath (http://code.google.com/p/libvmath)
